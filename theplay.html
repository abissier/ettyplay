        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="theplay-p" vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="CreativeWork">Etty is a touring one-woman play based on <span
                property="isBasedOn">the diaries and
                letters
                of <span property="character">Etty Hillesum</span></span>, adapted and performed by
            <span typeof="CreativeWorkSeason" property="actor">Susan Stein</span>. Directed by <span
                typeof="CreativeWorkSeason" property="director">Austin
                Pendleton</span>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using only <span property="character">Etty Hillesum</span>'s words, <span property="accountablePerson">Susan
                Stein's</span> adaptation brings us to 1941 when Esther "Etty" Hillesum, a young Dutch Jewish woman, is
            living in <span property="contentLocation">Amsterdam</span>.
            Upon the recommendation of her therapist, <span property="character">Julius Spier</span>,
            she began a diary on <span property="ContentReferenceTime">8 March 1941 </span>to help her with her
            depression. Hoping to become a writer, the diaries
            take on their own literary life, presenting both Etty's growth as a writer and spiritual transformation. As
            deportations begin, she prepares for the three day journey eastward, she digs deeper into her soul to
            understand this piece of history and root out any hatred or bitterness, believing that humanity is the best
            and only solution for survival. Etty's words, insights and beliefs reach out from the <span
                property="keyword">Holocaust</span> and allow us
            to see the power of hope and individual thought in the most extreme circumstances. In her gentle yet
            forthright way, Etty asks us not to leave her at <span property="keyword">Auschwitz</span> but to let her
            have a bit of a say in what she
            hopes will be a new world.
            <br>

            Finding-etty encompasses theatrical and educational experiences designed to challenge participants to
            <span property="teaches">reexamine assumptions about the Holocaust and explore issues of resistance, human
                rights, social justice and
                individual responsibility</span>. We make available <span property="learningResourceType">study
                guides</span> to
            enrich an audience's experience of the play.
            Teaching artists work closely with educators to tailor to the needs of a given site a variety of writing and
            dramatic <span property="learningResourceType">workshops</span>. finding-etty teaching artists have also
            created a curriculum for teaching the Holocaust
            through the arts with a series of lessons that work independently or in conjunction with the play Etty.

            The mission of finding-etty is to use the writings of Etty Hillesum to promote social justice, to challenge
            prejudice by examining the consequences of genocide and to enable participants to explore their own personal
            stories alongside Etty's, as they consider their role in the struggle for human rights.
